-   [X] Vote on moving on to Purely Functional Data Structures (by Chris Okasaki)
    -   All in favor
-   [X] Start on basic amortization and persistence via lazy evaluation

## Purely Functional Data Structures

### Speaker: Remy

### SML

-   There exists a Haskell appendix rewriting most of this
-   $foo denotes a lazy evaluation of foo (analogous to BangPatterns in Haskell)

### Amortization

-   Physicist Method and Bankers Method

### Persistence

### Call by _

-   Call by Value: Strict
-   Call by Name: Lazy
-   Call by Need: Lazy + Amortization

### Amortization, Persistence, and Laziness

-   Reformulate amortization methods allowing for laziness

## Miscellany

-   Zippers
-   [Fast and Loose Reasoning is Morally Correct](citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.59.8232)
