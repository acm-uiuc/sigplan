## Discussion

* Initial discussion
  * Vote on moving on to Purely Functional Data Structures (by Chris Okasaki)
    * All in favor
  * Start on basic amortization and persistence via lazy evaluation
* Purely Functional Data Structures
  * Speaker: Remy
  * Standard ML
    * There exists a Haskell appendix rewriting most of this
    * $foo denotes a lazy evaluation of foo (analogous to BangPatterns in Haskell)
  * Amortization
    * Physicist's method and banker's method
  * Persistence
  * Call by _
    * Call by Value: Strict
    * Call by Name: Lazy
    * Call by Need: Lazy + Amortization
  * Reformulate amortization methods allowing for laziness
