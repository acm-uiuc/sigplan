* Andrew D'Angelo
* Phillip Harris

## Discussion

* General discussion, followed by a vote to decide what we should do:
  * Watch [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Lens for Business Applications][]
  * Watch [Typeclasses vs The World][]
  * Something else
* We decided to watch
  [The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Lens for Business Applications][]
* Lens
  * [Hackage page for lens][lens-hackage]
  * Useful tips on using `lens` in practice:
    * [`Control.Lens.Cons`][Control.Lens.Cons]
      --- useful for stream-manipulating functions that are generic over
      `Text`, `ByteString`, `[a]`, `Vector a`, `Seq a`, etc.
    * [`Control.Lens.Plated`][Control.Lens.Plated]
      --- contains generic traversals (ana/catamorphisms) that work well with
      other things in `lens` and don't require incurring any new dependencies
    * [`Control.Lens.TH`][Control.Lens.TH]
      --- pretty much essential for using `lens` in practice; particularly
      useful are the `makeLenses` and `makeClassy` Template Haskell macros.
  * [lens.github.io](https://lens.github.io)
* Pipes
  * [Hackage page for pipes][pipes-hackage]
  * Useful `pipes`-related libraries:
    * [pipes-safe][], [pipes-parse][], [pipes-concurrency][]
  * We worked on an example of how one would use an hypothetical web server
    that has a API consisting of a tuple of a `Producer Req IO ()` and a
    `Consumer Resp IO ()`.
    * The source code for that example is available [here][pipes-example]
* Miscellaneous
  * [Quantum Picturalism][], [string diagrams][], [monoidal categories][]
